# Wikiscraping

Requirements: coded with Python 3.7 but will probably work with Python 3 in general.

Uses the Wikipedia python library to allow the user to continually try again and again to search wikipedia from the console.

TODO: It will sometimes still show an error or warning, but will let you try again anyway. 
Works, but could be much more graceful.
